This is a collection of my Jupyter Notebooks and Python Scripts. This is for my 4rd year Emerging Technologies module in GMIT.


## Project Description
Your submission will have ﬁve main components. Each component is either a Jupyter notebook or a Python script. 
1. numpy random notebook: a jupyter notebook explaining the conceptsbehindandtheuseofthenumpyrandompackage,includingplots of the various distributions.
2. Iris dataset notebook: a jupyter notebook explaining the famous iris data set including the diﬃculty in writing an algorithm to separate the three classes of iris based on the variables in the dataset. 
3. MNIST dataset notebook: a jupyter notebook explaining how to read the MNIST dataset eﬃciently into memory in Python. 
4. Digit recognition script: a Python script that takes an image ﬁle containing a handwritten digit and identiﬁes the digit using a supervised learning algorithm and the MNIST dataset. 
5. Digit recognition notebook: ajupyternotebookexplaininghowthe above Python script works and discussing its performance. 

## Technologies Used
The technologies used to create these notebooks are:

 * Anaconda/Python:
    * Tensorflow
    * OpenCV
    * Keras
    * Scikit-Learn
    * Numpy
 * Visual Studio Code
 * Github / Git
 
## How to run the program
1.1 To run this project, check and make sure you have all technologies noted below.

1.2 To run the the notebooks, download the full project. Open cmder and navigate to the project folder. Simply enter the command:
jupyter notebook 

This will launch Jupyter Notebook within your browser. You can simply navigate through the folder structure to view the notebooks.

1.3 To run the python script, you must open cmder and navigate to where the script is located. You then run the following command: 
python digitrec.py
